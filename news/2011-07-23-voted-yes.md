The expert committee has [voted yes](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=5227) on JSR-349. That means 
the work for Bean Validation 1.1 can start. Read some more on [Emmanuel's blog](http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/BeanValidation11HasStartedJoinUs).

The next few days will be dedicated getting an expert group up and running.
