Bean Validation 1.1 early draft 1 officially reaches the JCP and is available 
[on their website][jcp]. You already knew about it from the [release][blog-edr1]
and [artifacts][blog-artifact-edr1] announcements. 

That's still a significant milestone that has to be reached by the JCP rules.
A specification needs to produce a certain amount of output which is regulated
by the JCP itself. If you are curious, I encourage you to read the [process document][jcp-process].

Note that JSR-349 (Bean Validation 1.1) does run under the previous version of
this process but in practice we obey the rules of the current version 
(especially in openness).
