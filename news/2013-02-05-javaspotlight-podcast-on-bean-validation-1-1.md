Roger Brinkle from [Java Spotlight Podcast](https://blogs.oracle.com/javaspotlight/)
has interviewed me on the status of Bean Validation 1.1. It's 20 mins long so you
won't suffer too much :)

The podcast is available [here](http://goo.gl/UphGL).
Unfortunately the audio of the interview is not great, so if you find it hard
to follow, I have put an alternative recording with better quality of the
interview itself. [Get the mp3](/downloads/javaspotlight-119-interview.mp3).
