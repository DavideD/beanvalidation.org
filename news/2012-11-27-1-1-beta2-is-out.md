With Hibernate Validation, the reference implementation catching
up with the public review draft, we found a couple of minor glitches
to actually implement the specification. We did a minor release
to fix those glitches.

Check out the [specification](/spec/1.1/1.1.0.beta2) and make sure to
use 1.1.0.Beta2 if you plan on implementing the specification early.
