== Problem

Getters are the vehicle for properties which are handled in Bean Validation 1.0.
Should we also consider getter calls as regular methods. There are pros and cons for 
both approaches. Let's list them

NOTE: The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will,
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and
furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

And we resume

== Pros

A getter is a method: for the sake of consistency and least surprise, we should
consider getters when methods are validated.

Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche,
it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other,
but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out.
Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now.
We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't.

Action methods starting with `get` would be considered getters and excluded from
method validation.

Components subject to method validation (CDI components) are typically not the ones
hosting properties - though see below in cons.

== Cons

Applications with existing constrained properties might fail due to validation happening
at previously unexpected times (ie when getters are called).

Most `getProperty` / `isProperty` methods are getters 80%/20% rule.

While the problem might not be acute for CDI and its currently limited interception
capabilities, technologies like AspectJ will intercept and validate getters in
a much broader area.

Also, there are some thinking about making JPA entities actual CDI beans in which
case all getter calls could be intercepted. This is coming from the rich entity camp.
While not considered for EE 7, that might very well come in the future.

== Customization mechanisms

Because the choice is not clear, the consensus is that some customization 
mechanism should be available, either:

* as proprietary extensions
* as spec defined

Due to the usefulness and the usage impact with other specification integrations
I think we should standardize it in the specification.

=== Assuming getters are not considered methods to be validated by default

We could offer the following options:

* a global flag to enable getter validation +
  I fail to see the use case ATM, idea?
* a per method or per class flag `@ValidateOnCall(GETTER)` +
  that would require to define class inheritance rules on this annotation
  as well as method inheritance

=== Assuming getters are considered methods to be validated by default

We could offer the following options:

* a global flag to disable getter validation  
  we would use a global flag to disable JPA entity getter validations for example
* a per method or per class flag `@ValidateOnCall(GETTER)`  
  that would require to define class inheritance rules on this annotation
  as well as method inheritance

=== Assuming method validation has to be activated

We could envision to force all components expecting method validation to be
annotated either at the method or class level.

[source,java]
----
@ValidateOnCall({GETTERS, METHODS})
public class AddressService {
    public void addAddress(
        @NotNull @Valid User user, @Valid @NotNull Address address) {
        ...
    }
}
----

That would require to define class inheritance rules on this annotation
as well as method inheritance.

If we go that way, we might even imagine more features down the road like
`@ValidateOnCall(OBJECT)` to validate the whole object upon specific
method calls.
That would make the JAX-RS integration more "standard" but would force
people to explicitly mark components that ought to be method constrained
which we agreed was not the best outcome:

* verboseness - constraints declared and metadata annotation used
* easy to forget

=== Against `@ValidateOnCall`

Gunnar is on the side of not introducing `@ValidateOnCall` as it can be simulated
by groups:

[source,java]
----
public static class Foo {

   //doesn't get validated during method validation of Default group
   @NotNull(groups=AllConstraints.class)
   private String getBar() { ... }

   //does get validated during method validation
   @NotNull
   private String getBaz() { ... }
}

//use this e.g. to validate upon entity persisting
public interface AllConstraints extends Default {}
----

My problem with this approach is its verboseness and the fact that
teams might want to preemptively use this verbose pattern "just in
case".
